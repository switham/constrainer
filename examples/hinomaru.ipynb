Together the constraints say whether a combination of variable values is a solution or a dead end, without saying anything else about how to solve the problem. `constrainer` uses only true/false variables, so once you set up a problem correctly, you could search all the possible combinations of the variables until you found a solution.\n",

That doesn't necessarily mean that no tree searching is needed, but it cuts down the search space.\n",

This could be done with one variable per tile, but it's more symmetrical and actually easier with two.  These variables are stored in a nested dictionary `tile_shows_face[tile][face]`.
