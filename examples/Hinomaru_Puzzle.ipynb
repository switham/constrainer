      "\n",
      "The `constrainer` module was written to solve puzzles.  Using it amounts to analyzing the problem, writing code to feed it into an API, calling the solution generator, and writing code to present the results.  Perhaps it's anticlimactic to have the glory occur inside a black box (of course I invite you to read and modify `constrainer`'s source), but I like finding out whether new puzzles can be fitted to this minimalist framework.  This time there was a new wrinkle that will be explained later.  But first the raw data needs to be distilled.\n",

      "\n",
      "All of the sizes are divisible by three, so the tiles can only be placed on coordinates that are divisible by three, making it more like a 4 x 6 grid of 3 x 3... call them **squares**, with each tile being 1 x 2 (or 2 x 1) squares.  Each tile has two **faces**, and each face can only go in a place where it matches the 3 x 6 or 6 x 3 pattern of ones and zeroes.\n",
