A program has a set of variables, and a set of constraints about subsets of the variables that describe what must be true about the solution, without saying anything else about how to solve it.  When the solver is running, setting one variable can imply values for other variables through the constraints, causing avalanches of results to \"propagate\" from single choices.  That doesn't necessarily mean that no tree searching is needed, but it cuts down the search space.\n",

      "The code so far sets up choosing which side of each tile will show, and choosing which places on the board will have tiles, but not any relation between the two.  In a way it's implicit: each place only matches one face.  But a given face can potentially show up in multiple places and on multiple tiles.\n",
      "\n",
      "We could set this up as a set of choices: for each side of a tile that is showing, choose which eligible place it will go.  But those choices hardly matter.  If there are two identical faces to go into two places, there are two ways to arrange that, and if the first arrangement leads eventually to a dead end, then so will the second, doubling the time spent searching.  Choices that don't matter multiply and multiply the search time.\n",

      "What we want is to leave those choices out and set a looser constraint: if and only if the number of tiles showing each face is equal to the number of places where we choose to show that face on the board, the choices of tile-faces and places are consistent.  The `shows_eq_places[face]` constraint expresses that.\n",
