      "The `constrainer` module was written to solve puzzles.  Using it amounts to analyzing the problem, writing code to feed the problem into an API, calling the solution generator, and writing code to present the results.  I'm not entirely happy with the module's usability, but I enjoy breaking problems down into its minimalist framework.  This time there was a new wrinkle that will be explained later.  But first the raw data needs to be distilled.\n",

Each tile has two **faces**, and each face can only go in a place where it matches the 3 x 6 or 6 x 3 pattern of ones and zeroes.\n",
